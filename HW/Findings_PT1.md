- Idle current consumption
  - 5mA at 64 MHz
  - 4.0mA at 4MHz (higher than expected)
  - 1.3mA at 1MHz (higher than expected)

MECHANICS
- Fix bearings
- add speaker Mount

COMMENTS
- use BAT down to 3.4V (lcd gets less and less visible)
- when nUSB_PD_OK = high, consider power budget to be 900 mA; charging max is 400 mA, therefore LEDs should be in sum <= 900mA - 400 mA (charging) - 300mA (DFPlayer) - 20mA (remaining circuit) = 180 mA (add some tolerance). Consider sum of main LEDs as well as background lighting LEDs -> see PCB_Bot "add high side switch between VBUS and D401" to eliminate this requirement. LEDs can be driven at full power at any time this this change. I assume the ouput of IC201 is limited to 400 mA at any time.
