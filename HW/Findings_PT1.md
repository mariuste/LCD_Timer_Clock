Findings

PCB_TOP
- variant problem in BOM (R502)
- BTN LED resistor missing (here or on PCB-BOT)
- Identifier in solder mask wrong (top - bot)

PCB_BOT
- silk of LEDs swapped (standby and charge)
- IC302 silk pin1 not visible
- IC400 assembly pin1 missing
- SW302 wrong type (resistor)
- assembly plan not cleaned up
- stencil cutouts for bat connectors (keepout holes)
- Identifier in solder mask wrong (top - bot)
- J200 +/- missing
- J200 add some clearance to J400
- 3V0 Ref not properly working at low bat voltages -> use VBUS anyway
- DFP Audio en pull-down
- Keepout for programmer backplate
- Move SWD to clear gear
